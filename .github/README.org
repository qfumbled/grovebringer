* TODO
- [X] Borrow more ideas from Elythh
- [X] Consider using Hyprland over labwc
- [X] Add optional / toggleable modules
- [X] Remove hardcoded usernames (Reason: Makes the flake more portable and user-friendly)
- [X] Firefox theming (currently having some problems - help needed)
- [S] Make nixvim configuration (Note: probably in the summer)
- [X] Use nix-sops
